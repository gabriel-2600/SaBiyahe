                                <p>Even before the 21st or the 20th century, the concept of transportation in the Philippines has already started with our ancestors’ usage of animals as the means to move goods, people, and their services from one place to another. A perfect and well-known example of such is the Kalesa. This mode of transportation has been used in the country for several centuries already. Kalesas today are still built similarly as it was before with the two-wheel carriage wrapped into the horse usually enough to carry around 3-5 persons. Additionally, Kalesas today are no longer primarily used for transportation in the Philippines, nonetheless, Kalesas are still serving some cultural heritage sites or historical streets in some parts of the country.</p>

Similar to the Kalesa, carabao carriages also have a two-wheel carriage that is used to transport people and goods in the country in the early 20th century – a mode of transportation which is also present in Manila at the time. However, carabao carriages today are no longer present in the cities as they are only being used primarily in areas where paved roads are still in the works.</p>

                                    The iconic Philippine jeepneys endure in the transportation system. They've evolved from a single design for busy streets. Progress brings modernized versions, accommodating more passengers in air-conditioned comfort on the same routes. These new jeepneys have a slightly higher fare but remain the most affordable choice among public transportation options. Public vehicles were the go-to transport vehicle for people who wish to have a more comfortable ride to their destination. </p>

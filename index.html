                                <p>Even before the 21st or the 20th century, the concept of transportation in the Philippines has already started with our ancestors’ usage of animals as the means to move goods, people, and their services from one place to another. A perfect and well-known example of such is the Kalesa. This mode of transportation has been used in the country for several centuries already. Kalesas today are still built similarly as it was before with the two-wheel carriage wrapped into the horse usually enough to carry around 3-5 persons. Additionally, Kalesas today are no longer primarily used for transportation in the Philippines, nonetheless, Kalesas are still serving some cultural heritage sites or historical streets in some parts of the country.</p>

                                <p>We all know that the Carabao is considered to be the country’s national animal, but did you know that it has also been used to move people before? Similar to the Kalesa, carabao carriages also have a two-wheel carriage that is used to transport people and goods in the country in the early 20th century – a mode of transportation which is also present in Manila at the time. However, carabao carriages today are no longer present in the cities as they are only being used primarily in areas where paved roads are still in the works.</p>
